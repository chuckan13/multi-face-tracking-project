# A Deeper Dive into Multi-Face Tracking in Unconstrained Videos

Abstract:
The problem of multi-object tracking is particularly interesting in the scope of videos containing multiple camera angle switches. We follow the approach of Lin and Hung in ”A Prior-Less Method for Multi-Face Tracking in Unconstrained Videos” to develop a prior-less multi-face tracking system for use in unconstrained videos. Results achieved with this system closely approximate the results of Lin and Hung. We then edit two components of the system as put forward by Lin and Hung, namely the tracklet generator and the feature extractor. Doing so allows us to observe experimentally that the quality of the tracklet generator, and necessarily the face or body part detector, used in our system has the largest effect on the performance of the system. We conclude that the tracklet generator and associated object detector of a multiple object tracking system have the greatest impact on performance of that system.
